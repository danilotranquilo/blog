I have countless projects in my head that I want to realize. From small automations of simple processes that will improve my everyday life to mobile games and fun apps. Those projects might or might not be useful, but they will help me to improve my coding skills for sure. During quarantine, I will code everyday for an hour (or more) and write about what I have learnt while coding.\n\nThis blog was made with the headless CMS strapi, which works quite well. I will write about the tutorials that have helped me to create this page. Hopefully, you will learn something as well by reading the articles!","published_at":"2020-04-08","image":{"publicURL":"/static/960d64dbe0f8c8adf7f823e8e5a47ed0/1dd4f1f67e4789408f6d490da9dc1385.JPG"}}},"pageContext":{"id":1}}}
